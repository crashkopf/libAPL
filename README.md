# libcrashkopf - Convenience for a Lazy Programmer
This library contains functions that I find myself reusing often.  They are generally
primatives (like linked lists or buffers), but there's also interfaces for things
like timers or logging.  I've tried to keep things as architecture-agnostic as
possible.
